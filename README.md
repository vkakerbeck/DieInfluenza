# DieInfluenza

This is a repository created to collect the work done during the 6th week of 2018. A rainy week with a high chance of flu. Actually we don't know about the rain
since we never saw the light of day during this week. We were at the institute for at least 12 hours every day and living off of energy rinks and coffee.
The code in this repository was written in approximately 3 days. We excuse all bugs and the lack of documentation. We don't know if it is the lack of sleep or the
high amount of sugar in our blood but we see a great potential in the project and think it can lead to great change in the health systhem. Even if it all be forgotten
after this hackathon we will always remember the fun time we had during the past days. Thank you to all the organizers and to the Robert Koch Institute!
